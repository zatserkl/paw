Read about navigation in the histogram file/memory in paw.pdf, p.44

E.g.

Several files can be attached via HIST/FILE during a PAW session. To change the current file it is
enough to execute CD //LUNn (p ??) where “n” is the first parameter given to HI/FILE. Note
that the command LD // (p ??) gives the list of all the files currently attached. Each attached
direct access file is similar to a directory (cf UNIX).
